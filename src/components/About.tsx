            About Me
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I am a passionate and driven full-stack developer, constantly
            seeking to build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly web
            applications. With a strong foundation in modern JavaScript and web
            technologies, I specialize in both front-end and back-end
            development, leveraging frameworks like React.js, Node.js, and
            Express to create seamless digital experiences.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            My expertise also extends to database design, API development, and
            cloud deployment, ensuring that the applications I build are not
            only functional but also highly maintainable and performant.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I regularly practice Data Structures and Algorithms on platforms
            like LeetCode to sharpen my problem-solving abilities. Iâ€™m also
            familiar with AI and machine learning principles and look forward to
            integrating them into future projects.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Outside of coding, I contribute to open-source projects, write
            technical blogs, and mentor junior developers. I believe in
            continuous learning and strive to work on impactful projects that
            solve real-world problems.
